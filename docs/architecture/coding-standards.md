## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

## Documentation in code

- A module's purpose goes in `@moduledoc` and a public function's in `@doc`, never in a `#` comment above the definition. A `#` comment is for a note that is not documentation: why a line reads the way it does, or a caveat about the code directly below it
- `@doc` is discarded on a `defp`, so a private function's explanation is a `#` comment
- One `@doc` per function, on the first clause or on a bodyless function head. A second `@doc` on a later clause silently replaces the first and fails the build under `--warnings-as-errors`
- A docstring says what the thing is for and how to call it. Mechanism, trade-offs, and the history of a decision go in `#` comments beside the code they explain
- Keep both short. A docstring is read by someone already in the code, so it states what that reader needs rather than pointing at a `docs/` file for it. A module or function supporting a fixed set of values lists them where they are defined, so the list cannot drift from the code implementing it

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

  ```elixir
  i = 0
  mylist = ["blue", "green"]
  mylist[i]
  ```

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

  ```elixir
  i = 0
  mylist = ["blue", "green"]
  Enum.at(mylist, i)
  ```

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

  ```elixir
  # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
  if connected?(socket) do
    socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
  end

  # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
  socket =
    if connected?(socket) do
      assign(socket, :val, val)
    end
  ```

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

## Phoenix guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

  ```elixir
  scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
    pipe_through :browser

    live "/users", UserLive, :index
  end
  ```

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it
